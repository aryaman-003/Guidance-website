        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="Cities"><b>Navi Mumbai:</b></li>
            <p>Upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport will be a great thrust to Navi Mumbai real estate. The first phase is expected to be completed by 2024. 
    
                An increase in direct and indirect employment will boost the overall need for residential and rental properties. Airport’s proximity will benefit the nearby localities such as Panvel, Ulwe, Kopar Khairane, Seawoods, and Sanpada. 
                
                There has already been a trend for a considerable appreciation of the properties in the Navi Mumbai Area. Upcoming Infrastructure Projects
                Besides Navi Mumbai International Airport, there have been many upcoming projects which will boost the connectivity of the region. 
                 Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) will connect Navi Mumbai to the mighty Mumbai city. This is going to be India’s longest sea bridge (21.8mtrs in length) expected to be completed by September 2022. 
                The Mumbai Pune Hyperloop will bring the journey time between the cities to just 25mins. It will have Navi Mumbai International Airport as a stop. 
                Navi Mumbai Corporate Park in Kharghar is under planning and will be built in the plot area of 345 Acres. This will become the next industrial cluster of Navi Mumbai. 
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Navi-Mumbai.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
            <li class="Cities"><b>Pune:</b></li> 
            <p>Pune drives 13 percent of the states GDP and is the 3rd largest contributor to India’s IT exports.
    
                It is emerging as a megacity for its sound connectivity, technology, and industry.  
                
                Property values in Pune are giving an attractive Return-on-Investment (ROI) to homebuyers. The rental incomes are also promising in the region. 
                
                In the first quarter of 2021, there were 18042 newly launched projects which is a 43% increase as compared to the last quarter. And around 75% increase in the overall real estate sales. The upcoming new Pune International Airport in Purandar Tehsil is planned over an area of 2400 hectares and is expected to be complete by 2024. This will boost the economic activities of the region with the upliftment of areas such as Dhanori and Charholi Budruk.
                A colossal industrial park in Chakan is a 350 crore project to be developed over the next three years. It will be an ideal destination for the factories and create an industrial cluster in the Chakan region.
                The Mumbai Pune Expressway has been optimized and upgraded to reduce congestion. 
                The High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) is an impressive plan that will provide seamless connectivity to the Pune districts. The project has received impressive Foreign Direct Investment. 
                Also, by the end of the year, Metroline 1- PCMC to Phugewadi will become operational by the end of this year to provide solid connectivity. 
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Pune.jpg">
            <br>
            <li class="Cities"><b>Banglore:</b></li>
            <p>Ease Of Living, Expanding IT parks and Manufacturing hubs have been the main reason for preferring Bangalore for a real estate investment. 
    
                In Bangalore, Residential Real Estate is gradually moving up. According to the India Residential Market Update- Knight Frank Report, there was around an 18% increase in sales in the first. This trend is expected to continue throughout 2021. 
                
                In recent times, North and South Bangalore has been marked as well as real estate investment prospects.The central Govt has sanctioned Metro line Phase 2A and 2B that will connect Central Silk Board with Kempegowda International Airport. This will have a positive impact on the connecting areas of this route.
    
                Bangalore- Mysore Infrastructure Corridor is a four-six lane expressway connecting important cities such as Bangalore, Mysore, and other regions in Karnataka. This is expected to reduce the travel time between the two cities from 90-180 mins and is expected to be completed by 2022.
                
                Also, the Hyperloop corridor between the Kempegowda International Airport and the Bengaluru CBD area, with an estimated speed of 1080 Kmph is under the primary phase.
                
                <span class="Important">The Urban Development Department (UDD) has proposed an amendment in the Karnataka Planning Authorities Rules, 2020. This will reduce the betterment fee to 0.2-0.5% from 0.5-1.5% giving relaxation to buyers.</span>
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Bangalore.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
                <li class="Cities">Chennai:</li>
                <p>There are two reasons for surging housing transactions in Chennai. First, all-time low-interest rates and second many discounted deals offered by the leading developers in Chennai. 
    
                    The city added over 4,500 new housing units in Q1 2021 and most of them were added by the A grade developers. 
                    
                    Another notable trend in Chennai is the emergence of peripheral locations giving more buying opportunities. There has been a rise in the IT, Auto industries in the peripheral region.
                <span class="Important">In the Government Budget 201-22, Rs, 76000 crores have been allocated for the Bangalore and Chennai Metro projects. It will be great infrastructure leverage to both the cities. 
                    The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority is preparing the third master plan to be effective from 2026-2046. This plan will focus on increasing affordable housing, industrial scaling, trade, and commerce among the others.</span>

                <br>
                <br>
                <li class="Cities"><b>Noida:</b></li>
                <p>Noida’s planned infrastructure and Affordability has been the key driver of real estate.
    
                    Jawar Airport will be a game-changer from Noida as it will boost the overall employment in the region. Many MNC companies can settle in the Noida region because of airport proximity. 
                   
                   Moreover, Noida is likely to give better ROIs on the properties in the upcoming times.
                <span class="Important">The stamp Duty charges in Delhi NCR are likely to decrease because of 20 percent deductions in the circle rates till September 2021. 
    
                    In its housing scheme,  the Delhi Development Authority has planned to launch a housing scheme with over 1300 flats.</span>

                <br>
                <li class="Cities"><b>Kolkata:</b></li>
                <p>Kolkata is the most affordable real estate destination for investment in real estate in India. 
    
                    There has been a rise in the affordable house segment in Kolkata because of the growth in infrastructural facilities all over the city. 
                    
                    Recently there has been increased sales volume and launched projects in the city. About 18 residential projects were launched in the first quarter of 2021 with more to the South and North parts of the city. 
                <span class="Important">The KMC is planning to bring a 60% waiver on the interest accrued on the property tax dues.

        <h1 class="Marketing">MARKETING STRATEGIES for BUILDERS</h1>
            <br>
            <p>For Builders who are just starting in the Profession of Construction, here are a few basic marketing 
                strategies that you can implement which does not involve a lot of Investment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="Heading-one">Contact a Large Number of Real Estate Agents:</h2>
            <p>Get in touch with as many real estate agents as you possibly can inform them about your project,
                share the details, <span id="suggestion">and every alternate week contact them and give them a reminder</span> because you are not the 
                only Builder they are working with how will they remember you when they have a Prospective Customer but you had
                only Contacted them once. In order to mark your differentiating factor you can even tell them that you offer 3% commission instead of
                the standard 2% commission to your agents, give them reasons to remember ypu when they have a Customer. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="Heading-two">Have an Online Presence:</h2>
            <p>Get yourself on an Online Platform through any form be it Social Media,Youtube,Websites or 
                Online Advertising. If you are just starting out and there is a Crunch of Money create a channel on Youtube or Facebook
                and advertise there free of cost, even Instagram create stylish videos inform customers about the perks of that area in which the property is 
                and the kind of home that you are providing. The ideal way should be to create a Website but if you don't know how to 
                create a Website yourself neither know someone personally who will do it for you, and look for getting it done through a 
                Website Development agency it can cost you a pretty hefty sum of money because of the Industry you are in,
                even <span id="knowledge">the most standard and basic Real Estate Website development can cost you somewhere between Rs 20,00-Rs 30,000;
                and if you are just starting out in this business and there is a shortage of money every penny counts</span>, but after 
                you have been in the business for a certain amount of time you should definitely build a website.
                You can also opt for Online Advertising on platforms such as MagbicBricks.com and Housing.com and various others sites,
                where at a basic cost of between Rs 2,000-Rs 4,000 you can get a listing done<span id="warning">(have a thorough talk with the Representative of that comapny about what all features you will be getting before you get into anything.)</span>
